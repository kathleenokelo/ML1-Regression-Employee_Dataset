# ML1-Regression

## House Price Prediction Project
In this project, I work with real estate data to build a predictive model that estimates house prices based on various property features. The goal is to apply regression techniques and leverage the skills you've gained to create a model that performs well on unseen data.

### Project Overview
Objective: Build a regression model that predicts house prices using the features provided in the dataset.


### Data Preparation
Data preparation is crucial before model training. Some important steps include:

### Handling Missing Values
Address any missing data by either imputing or removing it.
-Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert non-numeric variables like neighborhood or property type into numeric formats (e.g., using one-hot encoding).

-Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize numeric features to ensure they are on a similar scale.

-Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve the modelâ€™s performance.

-Train-Validation Split: Optionally split your training data into training and validation sets to fine-tune your model.

Apply these steps consistently to the dataset.

### Model Training
Explore and experiment with various regression models to predict house prices. You can use the following methods:

>-Linear Regression

>-Polynomial Regression

>-Ridge Regression

>-Lasso Regression

>-Elastic Net Regression

Use evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error(MSE) and R2 score to gauge the performance of your model. Fine-tune the model parameters to achieve the best results.
